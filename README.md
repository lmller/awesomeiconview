# AwesomeIconView
AwesomeIconView is an Android View that displays a FontAwesome icon!

### What is Font Awesome?
Font Awesome is the "The iconic font and CSS toolkit", which basically means you can use text to display icons. No images needed!

### Why a library for Android?
Many UI designers originally come from web development. They are therefore used to working with Font Awesome. 
If a designer tells you to use e.g. the "Android" font awesome icon, you can now do so without having to export a png.
I once ran into this problem at a project, so I created this library back in 2013. Maybe there is already a more sophisticated one, but I decided to share this anyway.

### How to use it
Drop the aar from the libraries folder into your app's own library folder.
Check the Font Awesome Cheat Sheet at https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/ to pick the icon you want.

**Note:** This library is currently in early alpha, os it only supports 6 different icons. Will be updated ASAP.
